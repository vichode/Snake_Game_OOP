# 🐍 Snake Game (Object-Oriented Python)

This project is a modern, class-based implementation of the classic Snake Game built using Python's **Turtle Graphics** module.  
It demonstrates my growing mastery of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, including **class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and code reusability**.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is more than a beginner’s Snake Game, it’s a structured, maintainable, and scalable version of the game developed entirely with Python classes.

Key OOP concepts applied:
- **Class Inheritance** – Clean separation of logic across classes (Snake, Food, Scoreboard).
- **Encapsulation** – Each class handles its own behavior and attributes.
- **Modular Design** – Game logic split into multiple files for clarity and reusability.
- **Slicing** – Used to manage the snake’s body movement and growth efficiently.

## 🎯 Features
- Dynamic scoreboard that updates in real-time  
- Collision detection (walls, tail, food)  
- Smooth movement and adjustable game speed  
- Restart option using keyboard input  
- Clear structure and comments for learning and improvement
